## Target: Detect and compute the deforestation square in the sattellite images.

<p align="justify">
Today, it is becoming increasingly important to realize how much living forest is being cut down. Forest biodiversity is an integral and very important part of our country and the planet. Forests play a key role in maintaining ecological balance and provide unique conditions for animals, plants, and microorganisms. They also perform important functions in water supply and climate change mitigation. However, despite all this, global deforestation is happening at a rate that exceeds resource renewal. This topic is relevant because understanding the scale helps to identify the problem and ways to solve it, such as preserving forest areas, restraining resource consumption growth, developing sustainable forest management methods, and creating public awareness of the ecological value of forests. The method developed in the work allows obtaining reliable data on the area of   deforested forest using open cartographic sources and Python programming language libraries.


The subject of research is satellite images of forest areas obtained from the cartographic service Yandex Maps by taking a screenshots. All images contain the target object representes as sections of cleared forest.
